Hey all!

Hopefully, all of you have scheduled a call with your mentor this week. üéä

We have a schedule for our cohort calls - Like the last cohorts, we have participants from many different time zones (check out all projects and participants). Therefore the cohort calls will take place between two alternating time slots. Cohort calls will always be on Wednesday every two weeks, but one week we‚Äôll have a call at 11:30 UTC, and the other week we‚Äôll have a call at 16:00 UTC. Here is what it would look like:

-   **Week-1 (this week):** Mentee-Mentor call (get to know your mentor!)

-   Week-2, the first cohort call will take place on Wednesday, 22 September 2021, 11:30 - 13:00 UTC (see in your time zone)

-   **Week-3: Mentor mentee call** (review your project and progress) ‚Üê _create a recurring meeting with your mentor_

-   We have decided to have two welcome calls (first cohort call), one on Week-02 (11:30 - 12:30 UTC) and the other on Week-03 (16:00-18:30 UTC) to welcome each of you properly and allow space to ask questions that can help you in getting started with your journey in OLS-4.

-   On Week-4, the second cohort call will take place on Wednesday, 6 October 2021, 16:00 - 17:30 UTC (see in your time zone)

-   **Week-5: Mentor mentee call** (review your project and progress)

-   ...

**üé• If you can‚Äôt make it** \- we‚Äôll be recording all the cohort calls. Notes will be available immediately, and the recording a few days later once it‚Äôs been processed and uploaded to YouTube. We plan to host open office hours in the week after cohort calls for folks who may miss the call but would like to ask questions and discuss some concepts. Details will be added to the website and calendar.

**üóì We will soon send out calendar invitations** \- Time zones can be confusing. Please treat the Google Calendar invitations as the source of truth, when in doubt! We‚Äôll also update the times and links on the website this week ([https://openlifesci.org/ols-4/schedule/](https://openlifesci.org/ols-4/schedule/))[)](https://openlifesci.org/ols-4/schedule/)).

**üñ• We will use Zoom and** **~Google Docs~** **Etherpad** **for our cohort calls** \- a Zoom link will be added in the shared agenda Etherpad document (see the week-1 Etherpad) and calendar invites. You can check beforehand if you have Zoom installed and it works on your computer by using this link: [https://zoom.us/test](https://zoom.us/test). If you have any accessibility needs that we haven‚Äôt already discussed with you, please let us know by emailing team@openlifesci.org so we can make appropriate arrangements. Cohort calls will have auto-captions available by default (we use otter.ai for live captioning).

**‚úèÔ∏è Assignments and your notes with your mentors**
We have shared a HackMD document with a template for your mentee-mentor calls. Please take a few minutes with your mentor to go through the format and set some personal goals. A self-assessment survey has been added for this week. Please make a copy of the assignment and take the survey reflecting on your practices from previous projects.

**üëÄ Information that you have already received - but we invite you to review:**

-   We have added you to this mailing list as well as to the Slack workspace. If you (or a team member) haven‚Äôt received a notification or would like to change your email, please let us know. (Please join Slack if you can! It is the fastest way for us to share info and reach you during the cohort. Let us know if you have not yet received an invite.)

-   If any of your team members have not received an email, most likely they still need to fill out the confirmation form, please share it with your team members so that they are added to this mailing list.

-   You can subscribe to this Google Calendar for upcoming calls or view the calendar in the OLS-4 syllabus: [https://openlifesci.org/ols-4/schedule](https://openlifesci.org/ols-4/schedule). We will also send you a calendar invite via this mailing list.

-   **Microgrant reminder:** you are eligible to request a microgrant to help you cover expenses related to participation in OLS-4, or OLS-4 project-related costs. Please see this blog post for details and email us if you would like to request a microgrant: [https://openlifesci.org/posts/2020/11/23/micro-grants-in-2021-ols-3-ols-4/](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2020/11/23/micro-grants-in-2021-ols-3-ols-4/) 

Finally, we have just published an announcement mentioning your participation in OLS-4, along with the links to your projects: [https://openlifesci.org/posts/2021/09/07/ols-4-annoucement/](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2021/09/07/ols-4-annoucement/) (here is a Tweet: [https://twitter.com/openlifesci)](https://twitter.com/openlifesci)). Check out the details and share about the OLS projects in your network. Also, please connect with each other on the #ols-4-cohort Slack channel, and do let us know if you have any questions or concerns that we can help you with.

Best wishes,
